##Topic Scores
This analysis analyzes Arctic Council speeches and national arctic strategy documents by comparing the relative frequencies of words belonging to ten different topics. We have defined these topics by creating dictionaries of commonly mentioned words that relate to each.

The method used here calculates the fraction of words in each document belonging to each topic to calculate a document-level score. It then averages document-level scores for each country to create a country-level score.

###Preparing the data

This section loads the libraries and the text files sfrom three different folders. It also contains some excess code. Moving forward, we use the dataframes developed from the readtext function, not the corpuses, dtms, or dfms.

This version does not remove stop words, punctuation, etc. This should not adversely affect our results, since we are using a dictionaries method to calculate our scores.


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(stm)
library(igraph)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(readtext)
library(quanteda)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(plotly)
library(rworldmap)

#This sets the directory where the texts are located
DATA_DIR <- "C:/Users/laura/OneDrive/Desktop/Krogh-Arctic/Strategy Documents (new)"  

#This command reads in all the file names and stores the texts in a tidy dataframe
strategy <- readtext(paste0(DATA_DIR, "/*"))

#This identifies the row names of the dataframe, which are also used in the corpus
#Note that these docnames are not as nice as for the UN Corpus as they vary a bit

row.names(strategy) <- strategy$doc_id



#Do again for the other folder
DATA_DIR <- "C:/Users/laura/OneDrive/Desktop/Krogh-Arctic/Observer Documents"  
observer <- readtext(paste0(DATA_DIR, "/*"))
row.names(observer) <- observer$doc_id


#Third folder
DATA_DIR <- "C:/Users/laura/OneDrive/Desktop/Krogh-Arctic/Arctic Speeches"  
speeches <- readtext(paste0(DATA_DIR, "/*"))
row.names(speeches) <- speeches$doc_id

#Fourth folder
DATA_DIR <- "C:/Users/laura/OneDrive/Desktop/Krogh-Arctic/Official Speeches and Documents"  
officialspeeches <- readtext(paste0(DATA_DIR, "/*"))
row.names(officialspeeches) <- officialspeeches$doc_id


```

###Combining the data frames and restructing


```{r}
#unnest the tokens (words) and create a new data frame with each word as one row
strategydf <- unnest_tokens(strategy, word, text)

observerdf <- unnest_tokens(observer, word, text)

speechesdf <- unnest_tokens(speeches, word, text)

officialspeechesdf <- unnest_tokens(officialspeeches, word, text)

#combine the three data frames
totaldf <- strategydf %>%
  full_join(observerdf) %>%
  full_join(speechesdf) %>%
  full_join(officialspeechesdf)

#calculate the document lengths
words <- totaldf %>%
  group_by(doc_id) %>%
  mutate(length=n()) %>%
  ungroup()

#separate the doc_id into country and everything that follows
words <- words %>%
  mutate(doc_id2=doc_id) %>%
  separate(doc_id2, c("country", "misc"), sep = "_") 
```

###Defining the topic dictionaries
There are eleven topics:
1. environment
2. indigenous
3. transport
4. development
5. tourism
6. resources
7. fisheries
8. diplomacy
9. security
10. russia

```{r}
environment <- data.frame(c("Research", "science/scientific/scientist", "environment","climate","climate change","ocean","sea","sea level","atmosphere","air","ice","warm","melt","knowledge","station","base","glaciological","geological","biological","ecosystem","paleoclimate","laboratory","institution","conservation","preservation","temperature","data","measurement","study","precipitation","pollution","cryospheric","publication","biodiversity","academic", "glacier","disaster","observe","trend","predict","species","force","global warming","protect" ))
colnames(environment) <- "topic"

indigenous <- data.frame(c("nation", "local", "indigenous", "peoples", "community", "human", "social", "lives", "condition", "inhabitants", "well-being", "language", "health", "traditional", "culture", "rural", "residents"))
colnames(indigenous) <- "topic"

transport <- data.frame(c("transportation", "shipping", "import", "export", "maritime", "transport", "ship", "vessel", "navigation", "route", "channel", "northeast passage", "northwest passage", "northern sea route", "voyage", "commercial", "trade", "icebreakers", "water", "transit"))
colnames(transport) <- "topic"

development <- data.frame(c("Sustainable","development","economic","globalization","economic zones","commercial","production","strategy","benefit","capital","market","enterprise","opportunity","business","infrastructure","fund","industry"))
colnames(development) <- "topic"

tourism <- data.frame(c("tourism","tourists","rescue","ecotourism"))
colnames(tourism) <- "topic"

resources <- data.frame(c("oil","industrial/industry","resource","technology","energy","gas","carbon","infrastructure","build","exploit","mine","utilization","exploitation","natural","mineral","geothermal","wind","exploration","consumer","pipeline","extraction"))
colnames(resources) <- "topic"

fisheries <- data.frame(c("fish","fisheries","fishing","aquaculture","goods"))
colnames(fisheries) <- "topic"

diplomacy <- data.frame(c("strengthen","joint","relationship","peace","integration","cooperation","international","relations","diplomatic","contribute","parties","stability","equality","participants","connect","multilateral","bilateral","regional","global","coalition","collaboration","coordination","share","same","affairs","harmony","alliance","partnership","freedom","political","meet"))
colnames(diplomacy) <- "topic"

security <- data.frame(c("sovereignty","continentalshelf","State","nation","secure/security","stakeholder","governance","rule","UNCLOS","claim","jurisdiction","rights","interests","territory","zone","own","influence","spitsbergen","role","legal","law","just","treaties","treaty","military","defend/defense","position","independent","regulation"))
colnames(security) <- "topic"

russia <- data.frame(c("russia"))
colnames(russia) <- "topic"

china <- data.frame(c("china"))
colnames(china) <- "topic"

```

###Generating scores


```{r}
#defining a function to calculate the scores
# first count the words belonging to each topic in each document and create document score by dividing the count by the length of the document

countwords <- function(topic) {
docscores <- words %>%
   inner_join(topic, by= c("word" = "topic")) %>%
   group_by(doc_id) %>%
  mutate(count = n(), doclength=mean(length), score=count/doclength) %>%
   ungroup()

#calculating country scores by averaging document scores
countryscores <- docscores %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(country_score = mean(score))
}

```
